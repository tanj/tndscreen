# Think & Do HMI Screen Parser

This parser is being written so that I can perform variable cross
referencing between TnD Projects and the ScreenView HMI.

I am in the process of reverse engineering the file format to the
point of being able to pull out all the Project Tags and give some
kind of indication of how they are being used in the HMI. (VB Script,
displayed, set, reset, etc.)
